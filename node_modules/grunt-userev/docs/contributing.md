## Contributing

Welcome to the project. Choose a way that suits you. You'll need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).

### Submit a bug, or feature request

- Search [existing issues](https://github.com/salsita/grunt-userev/issues) to avoid duplicities.
- [Submit an issue](https://github.com/salsita/grunt-userev/issues/new) with label `bug`, or `enhancement`.
- For a bug, include any relevant information, e.g. task output, installed OS/Node.js/Grunt/grunt-userev versions, and steps to reproduce.

### Submit a pull request

- [Fork the repository](https://github.com/salsita/grunt-userev/fork) ([help](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)) and checkout new branch with `<type>-` prefix in name, where type may be feature, fix, docs, or chore.
- [Use](https://github.com/salsita/grunt-userev/blob/master/.jshintrc) the [popular JavaScript style convention](http://sideeffect.kr/popularconvention#javascript) and [winning JavaScript style](http://seravo.fi/2013/javascript-the-winning-style) with exception of 100 characters per line. In short, use 2 spaces indent, camelCase names, trailing comma, single quotes, semicolons, sparse spacing, and no trailing whitespace.
- For bugfix, write a test that exposes the bug and fails without the fix. Submit the test alongside.
- For a new feature, add tests that cover the feature.
- Lint and test your code with `grunt`, or `grunt watch` to watch sources and run tests on any change.
- Use commit messages that follow [Karma/Angular commit message convention](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/master/docs/dev/04-git-commit-msg.md) ([docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit#)). In short, use `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` header in imperative present tense, message body describing motivation/differences, and footer referencing related issues and breaking changes.
- [Create a pull request](https://github.com/salsita/grunt-userev/compare) to [grunt-userev](https://github.com/salsita/grunt-userev) [master](https://github.com/salsita/grunt-userev/branches) branch ([help](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)).
